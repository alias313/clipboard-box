# Autofocus Input

 Input element that autofocus on first render and on any keystroke that the browser doesn't override. Also pastes (CTRL + V), selects all (CTRL + A), and allows any text selection combo default action when blurred. 

List of combos I've tested on Linux:
- CTRL + V: Paste
- CTRL + A: Select All
- CTRL + BACKSPACE: Delete Previous Word or Delete Selected Text
- CTRL + DELETE: Delete Next Word or Delete Selected Text
- CTRL + Z: Undo text input
- CTRL + Y: Redo text input
